Ollama is a tool designed to simplify the deployment and management of LLMs.

## LangChain
LangChain is an LLM orchestration for building and managing LLM applications. It allows document processing, embeddings, and retrieval. With LangChain, you can efficiently handle document loading, splitting, and storing embeddings. It integrates with vector stores like Chroma to enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where you can query documents and combine the information with the modelâ€™s capabilities for more accurarate responses.
